# BBC Micro:bit Challenge 02 (UWE Bristol - BSc CS)
A simple program will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device using the LED's already provided to execute a morse code program on the Micro:bit with two Micro:bit devices using Bluetooth.

## Program Description
The program chosen for Challenge 02 is the "Radio Brute Force". It is an intermediate level program and the intended language to be written for Challenge 02 will be in C++ as it was done for challenge 01. The program will be executed on the BBC Micro:bit physical device once the device is powered on and connected to the computer or a external battery pack. There are two Micro:bit devices involved in this project. Micro:bit #1 is the transmitter and Micro:bit #2 is the reciever. Once Micro:bit #1 is powered on and Button A is pressed, it will use the radio on Micro:bit #1 to brute force Micro:bit #2 automatically with a series of combinations until the passcode digit is cracked. If Micro:bit #2's passcode digit is cracked, a scroll message already coded which only is issued if the device is cracked will display that Micro:bit #2 has been compromised. 


## Usage
The program is to only be executed on the BBC Micro:bit device. Attempts to execute the C++ source code's hex code intended for this device and Challenge 01 on any other IOT device has the chance of not to execute and probably run in to errors. Log in to Mbed if you wish to edit the main.cpp file given in this repository and to maybe compile a new program for yourself online after the Micro:bit device is connected to the computer using a Mico USB to USB cable. Compile the code, download and copy the .hex file on to the device and it will run on start.

## Prerequisites
#### 1 - BBC Micro:bit physical device
#### 2 - Computer running either Windows 8-10, currently supported versions of MacOS and Linux
#### 3 - Micro USB to USB cable (x 2 (optional))
#### 4 - Mbed Account with specifications done to execute and edit the source code online
#### 5 - External Battery Packs x (x 2 (optional))
